				<h3> Therabot<span id="tm">&trade;</span> </h3>
				<p> I am part of a team in the process of developing a robotic therapy support system. The goal is to provide 
				a small robotic dog to individuals undergoing therapy, especially those with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
				(PTSD). The robot will be used by an individual to perform therapy exercises at home to support the less 
				frequent supervised therapy sessions. It will also be used in supervised therapy sessions as a form of support. </br><br/>
				My contributions focus on creating a network of tactile sensors to measure a human's interactions with Therabot, and
				creating a model that can classify these interactions with specific gestures, allowing Therabot to respond with an 
				appropriate movement.

				<h3> Defining Dialect Groups with Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering</h3>
				<p> The Harvard Computer Society collected data from 30,934 participants from all 50 states on their typical language use. The participants
				answered a survey including 122 questions about their word choice and how they pronounce certain words.  I used this data to compare the answers of
				the participants from each state to propose dialect groups for the United States.  </br></br>
				
				Linguists have not settled on set boundaries for dialect groups because determining how different language use must be to define a 
				separate dialect is not a problem with a clear solution.  Because of this, I used a hierarchical clustering technique to visualize 
				relations without deciding a set difference between differnt dialects.  I proposed a division resulting in 9 dialect groups, but this is 
				just one representation of the complex nature of dialect relationships.</p>
